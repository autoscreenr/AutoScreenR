## Install ##

Download a self-install copy of AutoScreenR (ASRSetup.exe) and start the installation file.

If there is not installed R software on computer, setup itself will install the R program either from setup or from the site. AutoScreenR is tested with R program version 4.3.2. Using a newer version of R from the web is a minor risk.


## Main parts of program ## 
In subdirectory (for example in c:\Program Files (x86)\AutoScreenR\Data\Data4Tests\) of main program there are located sample data files for the first introduction of the program. You can open data sample file created in Excel (*.xls), R (*.rds) or SPSS (*.sav)
